%Goal: Obtain standard error of parameter estimates

%Calculation of standard error with secondary parameters.

%Linear models are those that have parameters are involved in linear
%fashion ... as long as the terms in the model are linear kind of
%parameters

%Non-linear regression for estimating parameters is half way ... you need
%standard error and correlation of your estimates...otherwise you won't be
%sure if your model is statistically sound.

%calculating mean and standard error for nonlinear systems is impossible
%technique to do it
%step1: get parameter estimate
%step2: linearize about that parameter estimate
%we assume the estimate is a constant (assume its error free for now, not
%true b/c is depends on the data, thats another assumption)
%and now you regroup all of the terms into the linear format we started
%with on the first slide
%get alpha and then calculate SE of estimates and are considered to be SE
%of original parameters

%approximation becomes inappropriate because of taylor series expansion
%type of methods ... SE can become large if difference between observed and
%predicted is large.

%Secondary parameters
%How do we get estimates of secondary parameters if we know primary
%parameters?
